Description: 
StudySpot is a way for students to find places to study within a certain radius of their location and provides helpful links to other websites that aide students studying. With StudySpot students no longer have to struggle to find a place to study when they have trouble concentrating at home. 

How to use: Users first need to sign up for an account. Next they click on the maps tab which is located in the navigation bar. Once on the map page users are able to type in either an address, city, or zip code. The user will then be able to see cafes and libraries near the location they entered; cafes have coffee icons and libraries have a stack of books for their icon. Students also have the ability to filter what they see: under the search bar students can select either coffee or libraries in order to just see one of the options. Students are also able to use the study resources page, located in the navigation bar. On the study resources page students are able to find other useful websites that they can use to help them with studying. There is a clickable picture of each of the listed resources with a quick description of each.
